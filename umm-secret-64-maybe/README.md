# Secret64
Secret64 is highly ispired by Adfly's ysmm code.

Adfly's ysmm code is located on the HTML file, and it stores the real url of the link. The url has been encoded with Base64 code and some of the string is flipped with certain way. Well, with simple Google technique, you can find the discussion [here](https://github.com/jkehler/unshortenit/issues/1).
